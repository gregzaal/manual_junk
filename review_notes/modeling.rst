Review Notes: modeling
**********************

- Remove everything not related to actual modeling (e.g. objects, parenting, empties should all be moved somewhere else)
- Clean up index page (rather than linking to every page in a sub-folder, just use the ``index.rst`` in the sub-folder)
- Italic text used as mock-headings (better to use actual headings)
- Incorrect header syntax (using `*`s for subheadings)
- Contains some empty files and plenty of `TODO` comments
- Curves sections contain some old incorrect info
- Some sections (e.g. `meshes/editing/duplicating/screw.rst`) have an unnecessarily large amount of text.
- Remove info about the history of tools (we only document the current state of blender)
- Most pages need a thorough review, possibly rewriting too.
- In selection basics page, mention that selection can be changed to :kbd:`LMB` in the user preferences,
  although this manual will always refer to the default hotkeys.
- Quite a lot of duplication on selection tool descriptions.
