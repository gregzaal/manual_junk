Review Notes: animation
***********************

- Contains several empty files
- Introduction is more of a pretty index page
- Some pages have double headings (e.g. `basics/actions.rst`)
- key_frames page is a stub
- Some strange formatting in `editors/graph/editing.rst` and `editors/graph.rst` (duplication too?)
- `editors/timeline.rst` contains first-person notes, strange roman-numeral headers,
  and bad indentation (long image captions)
- Quite verbose in places
- No need to include separate pages for animating lamps, materials, cameras, etc.
