Review Notes: extensions
************************

- Weasel words ("Unlike many programs...") in introduction
- python.rst: Title and "Welcome to the Blender 2.6 Python Manual." - remove version
- Use more ``literals`` when giving code examples
- Explicitly choose python as language in code blocks.
- Some empty headings in ``python/faq.rst``
- In ``python/references.rst`` links to  specific versions are old - needs better solution?
