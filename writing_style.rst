Writing Style
*************

- American English (e.g. modeling and not modelling, color and not colour).
- Use of correct grammar, appropriate wording and simple English.
- Sentences should be kept short and clear, resulting in text that is easy to read, objective and to the point.
- *Spell checking is strongly recommended.*
- Use a single space after full stops and before a new sentence.
- Do not write in first person perspective, about yourself or your own opinions.
  If you are unsure about how a feature works, ask someone else or find out who developed it and ask them.
- Unless the unit a value is measured in is obscure and unpredictable, there is no need to mention it.
- Avoid repetition of large potions of text - simply explain it once, and from then on refer to that explanation.
- Do not simply copy the tooltips from Blender. Most of the time people will come to the manual to learn about
  a feature because the tooltip did not give enough information.
- Including why or how an option might be useful is a good idea.
- Avoid technical explanations about the mathematical/algorithmic implementation of a feature if
  there is a simpler way to explain it (e.g. explaining how mesh smoothing algorithms work is unnecessary,
  but the blending types of a mix node do need a mathematical explanation).
